    "dungeon": """
    You're roused by the smell of your current location.  Groggy you look around at what appears to be some sort of prison cell.
Rats scurry around you, wondering if you are their next meal.  They cling to the shadows as if something bigger than them could strike.  
You don't remember being put here but you need to find a way out.  

    Looking at your surroundings might help you get a better idea where to go, but with how those rats are acting there could be danger 
around every corner.

    Your journey begins....
